          Nginx Proxy Manager CLI (the <code>nginxpm</code> command-line tool) is
          an open-source program that runs entirely on your own computer. It does{' '}
          <strong>not</strong> collect, transmit, or store your personal data on
          any server operated by the maintainer.
        </>

      <section>
        <h2>1. No data collection</h2>
        <p>
          The CLI runs locally on your machine. The maintainer operates{' '}
          <strong>no backend servers</strong> and receives <strong>no data</strong>{' '}
          from your use of the tool. There is no analytics, no telemetry, no
          tracking, and no advertising.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>2. Credentials &amp; local storage</h2>
        <p>
          Any credentials you provide, API tokens, personal access tokens,
          OAuth access/refresh tokens, or passwords, are stored{' '}
          <strong>only on your device</strong>, in a local configuration file in
          your home directory (typically{' '}
          <code>~/.config/nginxpm-cli/config.yaml</code>, created with owner-only{' '}
          <code>0600</code> permissions). They are never sent to the maintainer
          or any third party.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>3. Network connections</h2>
        <p>The CLI makes outbound network requests only to:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <strong>Your Nginx Proxy Manager instance</strong>, the server you
            configure, to perform the actions you explicitly request.
          </li>
          <li>
            <strong>GitHub&apos;s public API</strong>, to check whether a newer
            release of the CLI is available. This request contains no personal
            data.
          </li>
        </ul>
        <p>The maintainer is not a party to, and cannot observe, these connections.</p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>4. Data you access through the tool</h2>
        <p>
          When authenticated, the CLI reads and writes data in your Nginx Proxy
          Manager instance using the permissions you grant, solely to execute the
          commands you run. That data is shown in your terminal (or written to
          files you specify) and is <strong>not</strong> retained, copied, or
          transmitted anywhere by the maintainer.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h2>5. Third parties</h2>
        <p>
          The maintainer does not sell, rent, or share any data. The tool
          integrates no third-party analytics or tracking SDKs. Your use of Nginx
          Proxy Manager is governed by that service provider&apos;s own privacy policy.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Children</h2>
        <p>This tool is a developer utility and is not directed at children under 13.</p>
